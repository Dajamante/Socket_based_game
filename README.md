# DD1362_INET_queued

PLEASE NOTE:
We used tcod tutorial for the roguelike game available here. http://rogueliketutorials.com/tutorials/tcod/
The class input handler is directly copied from the tutorial, the class entity is build upon the entity class from the tutorial, other functions have been developped from this base.
